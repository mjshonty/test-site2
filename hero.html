      Leopold Green is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University. Dr. Green earned his
      Bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Hampton University, and then went on to pursue his doctoral studies at
      the University of California, Riverside. Professor Green’s work focuses on creating biological therapeutics
      to treat chronic illnesses. To do this, Dr. Green uses synthetic DNA to create tudes, which can be put into
      cells and allow proteins or other chemicals to pass through. This can dramatically alter how the cells work.
      This approach can be used, Dr. Green hopes, to treat chronic illnesses. He states that this work is a
      “beautiful balance of art and science and engineering.”

      We chose Dr. Green as our tech hero because his work intersects with our own lives in different ways. Mike
      has worked in a healthcare adjacent field for over 10 years, and was diagnosed with glaucoma at the age of 16.
      Dr. Green's work appealed to Sam because she has dealt with chronic illness in her life, and has been
      fascinated with new ways to treat various illnesses.

      Yasodara Córdova is a researcher and engineer from Brazil working in the fields of privacy, digital identity,
      and responsible AI (RAI). Before working in the tech industry proper, she was a citizen journalist whose work
      earned the Vladimir Herzog Award twice. Her work in the tech world includes building standards for the W3C,
      pushing female hacker spaces forward, serving as a consultant at Harvard, and using open data to assist
      countries in developing and integrating infrastructure to allow more citizen participation and find corruption
      among officials while a fellow at the World Bank. In Brazil she served as CEO of ‘Serenata de Amor Operation”,
      a project which utilizes open data and AI to analyze public spending and find fraud. Until February of 2025
      she was the chief privacy officer at Unico IDtech, a company that provides digital identity and identity verification services.

      As a woman of color from the so-called “Global South”, Yasodora brings a unique perspective on privacy,
      security, and identity that is easily excluded in Europe and the U.S. This is especially meaningful given the
      United States’ history of exploiting Latin American countries. Her work with organizations like the World Bank
      and research into RAI are focused on promoting citizen participation in government and stopping corrupt
      officials which can be seen as promoting democracy and resisting the authoritarian control that oligarchs
      thrive under. Yaso has been involved in hackerspaces for women including founding one of the first spaces in
      Brazil. She also promotes and speaks at events hosted by groups like PyLadies, that have the mission of helping
      marginalized people learn to code and become leaders in the tech industry.

      The technology that many of us use today fails to treat us as human, only as potential profit. There must be
      more perspectives in technology, especially if there are to be systems that have respect for privacy. From a
      journalist sharing the stories of those living on the outside of society to a technologist researching and
      engineering tools that promote democracy and respect privacy, it is because of Yasodora’s many identities that
      her work puts people at the forefront.
